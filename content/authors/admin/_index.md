I am a Senior Engineer/Researcher at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/home) developing low-power and compute-efficient computer vision/machine learning algorithms. 

Before joining Qualcomm, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University working with [Prof. Jennifer Dy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6h7b0fAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Prof. Octavia Camps](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htt9T1AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dana H Brooks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MR6GYYsAAAAJ&hl=en). I completed my PhD in Computing and Information Sciences from Rochester Institute of Technology under advisement of [Prof. Linwei Wang](https://pht180.rit.edu/cblwang/).

**Research**  
What I find exciting and truly satisfying working in modern AI and machine learning is the diversity of ideas from different fields like Physics, economics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, electrical engineering, control and neural network architecture engineering. Ideas have crossed fields and found interesting adaptations and interpretations resulting into ingenious solutions of problems both in machine learning and outside. It is beautiful and I feel happy to have contributed in this process. During PhD, I applied VAE as inductive bias in solving inverse problems (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04803.pdf)), and connected generalization with smoothness and invariance (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02948.pdf)). Later, I applied idea from learning theory to KL divergence estimation (see [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/54a367d629152b720749e187b3eaa11b-Paper.pdf)), and introduced the geometric interpretation of score-based generative models (see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04411.pdf)).

At Qualcomm, I am excited to work on machine learning, computer vision and AI research works that will be realized as product, and will have real-world impact on everyday lives of numerous people.
