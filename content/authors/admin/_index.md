I am a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern University working with [Prof. Jennifer Dy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6h7b0fAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Prof. Octavia Camps](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=htt9T1AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dana H Brooks](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MR6GYYsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I completed my PhD in Computing and Information Sciences from Rochester Institute of Technology under advisement of [Prof. Linwei Wang](https://pht180.rit.edu/cblwang/).

**Research**  
I am generally interested in computational and algorithmic aspects of learning. I like to ask deep questions and work towards fundamental understanding, often  with the help of mathematical analysis, while solving real world problems with practical applications. I strongly believe that both deep theoretical investigation and practical applications are equally important and I wish to pursue my research at this intersection.
I have experience of working on biomedical problems and medical image analysis as practical real world problems. These problems helped me understand what assumptions are reasonable and which questions are more important and require our immediate attention.

In my PhD thesis, I focused on learning and generalization in the context of reconstructing cardiac electrophysiological signals. Currently, as a Post-doc, I am pursuing research in three directions: 1) Core machine learning research, 2) Image processing and video analysis and 3) Medical image analysis and understanding.
