If we were to summarize the transformations in a dataset, how would we do it? What is the purest representation of how one data point transforms to another? Can we somehow learn this pure representation and transfer it to another dataset? Can we augment data in another dataset by transferring in this way?

These are the questions we are trying to figure out. I am working with Nilesh Kumar under supervision of Prof. Linwei Wang to try and figure out answers to some of these questions. We will keep you posted as we progress further.
