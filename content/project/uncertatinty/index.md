If we consider weight learnt by a neural network as a MAP estimate that maximizes the likelihood of data, then the question of full Bayesian posterior of the neural network weights becomes fundamental. How to obtain the posterior distribution in a computationally feasible way? How to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction and model from this Bayesian Deep Learning? And, what is the implication of learnt uncertainty in domains like medical imaging?

I am working with Pradeep Bajracharya under supervision of Prof. Linwei Wang to understand and answer these questions.
