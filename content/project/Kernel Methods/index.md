I am working on combining ideas from kernel methods and deep learning and applying them to solve problems in generative adversarial modeling, stability of deep networks, generalization, independence, gaussian process. 

I am working with Prof. Jennifer Dy and other members of Machine Learning Lab at NEU on these problems.
