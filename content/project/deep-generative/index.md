To solve the inverse problem of electrophysiological imaging, we use the probabilistic graphical model and inference framework. We show that we can combine information from different sources by leveraging the power of graphical models and design good inference strategies. Also, we explore how we can combine the modern deep generative models with the traditional graphical models and inference strategies to solve the inverse problem.
